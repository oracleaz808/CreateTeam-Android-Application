Create-Team
===========

This android application is a portion of the complete android application "Pitching Stats". "Pitching Stats" is an application to help keep track of stats for a baseball/softball pitcher. "Create Team" is supposed to simulate the first task the user will do when using the android application "Pitching Stats", which is creating a team, or teams so the user can create seasons for that team. Once Create Team application is completely finished I will then implement this application into the bigger application, "Pitching Stats". If you would like to know more about "Create Team" or "Pitching Stats", please comment anywhere on this repo, or e-mail me at: christiandcosta@gmail.com.

Both applications "Create Team" and "Pitching Stats" run on android 2.3.3 or higher.
